 * `Hermes React Native` target that speaks Runtime + Debugger. Everything in
 * this matrix needs only `Runtime.evaluate`, which that target supports. Note
 * the network inspector rides `Runtime.evaluate` too (it monkey-patches
 * `fetch`, it does not use the CDP `Network` domain), so it needs nothing from
 * the post-0.73 debugger stack. Requires a Debug `.vpkg` + Metro reachable from
 * the device — see the argent-tv-interact skill.

 *
 * Vega is deliberately absent even though the plain debugger-* tools do work
 * there (see DEBUGGER_TOOL_CAPABILITY). These tools deliver their payload over
 * `Runtime.addBinding` / `Runtime.bindingCalled`, and RN 0.72's Hermes ACKs
 * `Runtime.addBinding` without implementing it — the binding is never installed
