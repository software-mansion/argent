Use when you need to enter text or trigger a named key such as enter, escape, or arrow keys. On Vega and Apple TV / Android TV, prefer the remote tools for D-pad navigation; use keyboard to type into a focused text field (e.g. a search or login box).
Returns { typed: string, keys: number }. Fails if an unsupported key name is provided or the device's input backend is not reachable.
- text: types a string (supports uppercase, digits, common punctuation). To type a credential, use \`{{secret:<NAME>}}\` — resolved server-side from the \`ARGENT_SECRET_<NAME>\` env var (prefix mandatory; \`{{secret:APP_PASSWORD}}\` ↔ \`ARGENT_SECRET_APP_PASSWORD\`), so the plaintext never enters agent context; the result echoes the placeholder, not the value, and the after-typing auto-screenshot is skipped.
- key: presses a single named key (enter, escape, backspace, tab, arrow-up/down/left/right, f1–f12) — NOT supported on TV targets; move focus with \`tv-remote\` instead.
On a TV target (runtimeKind 'tv') only \`text\` applies — focus a text field first (with \`tv-remote\`), then type into it (injected HID keyboard on Apple TV, \`adb input text\` on Android TV).
Provide text, key, or both — when both are given, the text is typed first and the key is pressed after it (text + key:"enter" types and submits).`,
